Jupyter Notebook: Used to Run Project
You will need to have an Ethernet port available on your computer, and you will need to have permissions to configure your network interface. With a direct connection, you will be able to use PYNQ, but unless you can bridge the Ethernet connection to the board to an Internet connection on your computer, your board will not have Internet access. You will be unable to update or load new packages without Internet access.
Connect directly to a computer (Static IP):
Assign your computer a static IP address
Connect the board to your computerâ€™s Ethernet port
Browse to your IP Address
This opens up the Jupyter Notebook

The notebooks used for the final project are under the final project folder.
